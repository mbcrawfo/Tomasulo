# The script assumes that your program was written in Java
# and the code is in an Assemble.jar file and thus executes
# the command: java -jar Assemble.jar <input file>
# You will need to change the script, if this isn't the how to execute
# your code.
#
# If your program fails on an input file, then the input file, the
# output produced by your program on that input file, and a file 
# containing the differences between the output and the expected output
# are placed in your Tests directory.  If your program doesn't produce
# an output file for a particular input, then the input file alone
# is placed the Tests directory.  If your program passes all tests, then
# the Tests directory should be empty after running the script.
